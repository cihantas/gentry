        <h1>Cloture: Clojure in Common Lisp</h1>

            <q>Clojure namespaces are just packages. But of course Clojure is case sensitive, so you will need to use pipe characters to call, for example, |clojure.core|:|cons|.</q>
            Is this an implementation detail or a common lisp idiom to work with case (in)sensitivity?

                The statement you quoted is a bit misleading. Common Lisp is case sensitive just like Clojure, but unlike Clojure all of the standard library is spelt with upper case and the reader automatically concerts symbol names to upper case, unless you quote them, like in the given example.
